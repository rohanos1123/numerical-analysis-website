## Purpose:
This is a website that aims to educate visitors on various numerical methods and the stablility analysis of these methods. 

## Methods: 

### Lagrange/Global interpolation: 
* The Lagrange/Global interpolant can form polynomial approximations of functions over a    provided interval. The user can choose between multiple interpolation nodes including the chebyshev, equally spaced, and custom nodes.
